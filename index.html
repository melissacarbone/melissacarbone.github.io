          <h2> About Melissa</h2>
            <p>
              I'm a NYC-based web developer who recently completed <a href="http://launchacademy.com" target="_blank"> Launch Academy.</a> What I love most about web development is that it has given me the skills and ability to create something that can impact the lives of so many other people.  Helping others has always been important to me, as my prior professional experience is in psychology and counseling.  This understanding of behavior influences my approach to software development. My interests include giving back to the development community, contributing to open-source projects, and participating in organizations and events that are geared towards increasing the number of women in tech.
